# RTS Game: Resource Management Powered by Zama's FHE Technology

Experience a revolutionary real-time strategy (RTS) game where resource management is not only strategic but also confidential. Utilizing **Zama's Fully Homomorphic Encryption technology**, this game ensures that your resources are secure from prying eyes while providing a dynamic gameplay experience. 

## Problem Statement

In traditional RTS games, players often have full visibility over their opponents' resource allocations, leading to predictable and often unfair advantages. Players can easily assess their adversaries' strengths, making strategic deception nearly impossible. This visibility diminishes the strategic depth and excitement inherent to the genre.

## The FHE Solution

This project leverages **Zama's Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE)** technology to tackle the transparency dilemma. By encrypting resource data using **Zama's open-source libraries**, such as **Concrete**, we obscure the true state of players' economies. Opponents can only gather vague information about resource levels through scouting, transforming the economic warfare into a game of misdirection and intrigue. This not only enhances the competitive edge but also challenges players to refine their macro-management and intelligence analysis skills in a secure environment.

## Key Features

- **FHE-Encrypted Resource Data:** Players' resource quantities and collection speeds are encrypted, ensuring that opponents cannot determine exact levels.
- **Ambiguous Reconnaissance:** Scouting returns vague information about enemy resources, providing a strategic advantage and enabling psychological warfare.
- **RTS Economic Warfare:** The game elevates resource management into a deeper, more complex battle of wits and strategy.
- **Competition in Intelligence:** Players must not only manage resources but also outsmart their opponents through deception.

## Technology Stack

This project employs cutting-edge technologies to ensure a smooth and secure gaming experience:

- **Zama FHE SDK:** Core technology for confidential computing.
- **Node.js:** JavaScript runtime for server-side and tooling.
- **Hardhat:** Ethereum development environment for smart contract deployment.
- **Solidity:** Language for implementing smart contracts.

## Directory Structure

Here’s the structure of the project:

```

## Installation Guide

To set up the project on your local machine, follow these steps:

1. **Prerequisites:**
   - Ensure you have **Node.js** installed on your system.
   - Install **Hardhat** for Ethereum smart contract development.

2. **Setup:**
   - Navigate to the project directory.
   - Run the following command to install the necessary dependencies, including Zama FHE libraries:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

   ⚠️ **Do NOT use `git clone` or any URLs for installation.** This project must be manually downloaded.

## Build & Run Guide

To compile, test, and run the RTS game project, execute the following commands:

1. **Compile the Smart Contracts:**

   ```bash
   npx hardhat compile
   ```

2. **Run Tests:**

   ```bash
   npx hardhat test
   ```

3. **Deploy the Contract:**

   ```bash
   npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js
   ```

4. **Start the Server:**

   ```bash
   node src/index.js
   ```

## Code Example

Here’s a snippet demonstrating how to set up a basic resource manager in the game, utilizing Zama’s FHE for data security:

```javascript
import { FHE } from 'zama-fhe-sdk';

class ResourceManager {
  constructor() {
    this.resources = FHE.encrypt(100); // Start with 100 encrypted resources
  }

  gatherResources(amount) {
    const newResources = FHE.encrypt(amount);
    this.resources = FHE.add(this.resources, newResources); // Encrypted addition
  }

  getResources() {
    return FHE.decrypt(this.resources); // Reveal only when needed
  }
}

// Usage
const manager = new ResourceManager();
manager.gatherResources(20);
console.log(`Current Resources: ${manager.getResources()}`); // Displays decrypted resources
```
